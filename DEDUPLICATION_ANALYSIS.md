## üéØ Key Differences After Deduplication

| Aspect | ARCHITECTURE.md | UPDATE_SUMMARY.md |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Technical reference | Usage guide |
| **Depth** | Deep dive | High-level |
| **Metrics** | Full details with calculations | Quick reference only |
| **Examples** | 50+ code examples | None (points to main doc) |
| **Diagrams** | Full Mermaid code | Describes diagrams |
| **Audience** | Technical teams | All audiences |
| **Use Case** | Implementation & troubleshooting | Getting started & navigation |

---

## üìñ Content Distribution

### Technical Content (ARCHITECTURE.md only)
- Mermaid diagram source code
- Configuration examples (YAML, HCL, Java)
- Performance optimization techniques with calculations
- Cost optimization strategies with dollar amounts
- Security implementation details
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Monitoring setup instructions

### Meta Content (UPDATE_SUMMARY.md only)
- What was changed in the update
- Document statistics
- How to read the document
- Navigation guide
- Use case scenarios
- Implementation phases
- Related documentation

### Shared Content (Minimal overlap)
- Component names (list only in summary)
- Metric categories (detailed in main doc)
- Architecture capabilities (detailed in main doc, brief in summary)

---

## ‚ú® Benefits of Deduplication

### 1. Clarity of Purpose
- **Before**: Two documents with overlapping content - confusing which to read
- **After**: Clear separation - main technical doc vs. usage guide

### 2. Easier Maintenance
- **Before**: Update metrics in two places when changes occur
- **After**: Update only ARCHITECTURE.md, summary auto-references it

### 3. Reduced File Size
- **Before**: UPDATE_SUMMARY 15KB with duplicated content
- **After**: UPDATE_SUMMARY 12KB focused on meta-information

### 4. Better User Experience
- **Before**: Read duplicate information in both files
- **After**: Quick summary guides you to detailed sections

### 5. Single Source of Truth
- **Before**: Metrics might differ between files if one is updated
- **After**: ARCHITECTURE.md is the authoritative source

---

## üîÑ Update Workflow Going Forward

### When Updating Architecture

1. **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** (main document)
   - Modify diagrams, components, or benefits
   - Update metrics and performance numbers
   - Add/update configuration examples

2. **Update ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** (if needed)
   - Update document statistics if major changes
   - Add to version history
   - Update navigation guide if structure changes
   - **Do NOT duplicate technical details**

3. **Verify Cross-References**
   - Ensure summary links to correct sections
   - Check that quick reference tables are still accurate
   - Validate related documentation links
