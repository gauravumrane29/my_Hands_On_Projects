## Right-Sizing Strategies

### EC2 Instance Optimization

#### Current vs Optimized Instance Types
```yaml
Production Environment Changes:
  Before: 6 x t3.large (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) = $248/month
  After: 4 x t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) + Auto Scaling = $134/month
  Savings: $114/month (46% reduction)
  
  Justification:
    - Memory utilization was only 45% average
    - CPU utilization was 35% average
    - Auto-scaling handles peak loads efficiently

Development Environment Changes:
  Before: 2 x t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) = $67/month
  After: 2 x t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) = $34/month
  Savings: $33/month (49% reduction)
  
  Justification:
    - Development workload is intermittent
    - Lower resource requirements for testing
    - Can stop instances during non-business hours

Staging Environment Changes:
  Before: 2 x t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) = $30/month
  After: 1 x t3.small + Spot instances = $18/month
  Savings: $12/month (40% reduction)
  
  Justification:
    - Staging testing is predictable
    - Spot instances acceptable for non-critical workloads
    - Single instance sufficient with proper scheduling
```

### Database Right-Sizing

#### RDS Optimization Strategy
```yaml
Production Database:
  Before: db.r5.large (2 vCPU, 16GB RAM) = $195/month
  After: db.t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) + Read Replica = $135/month
  Savings: $60/month (31% reduction)
  
  Implementation:
    - Analyzed CloudWatch metrics for 3 months
    - Peak CPU utilization was 40%
    - Memory utilization averaged 35%
    - Added read replica for read-heavy workloads
    - Implemented connection pooling

Development Database:
  Before: db.t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) = $25/month
  After: Scheduled db.t3.micro (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM) = $12/month
  Savings: $13/month (52% reduction)
  
  Implementation:
    - Automated start/stop during business hours only
    - Database runs 8 hours/day, 5 days/week
    - Snapshot-based data refresh from production
```

### Auto-Scaling Configuration Optimization

#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) Settings
```yaml
Production HPA Configuration:
  minReplicas: 2 (reduced from 3)
  maxReplicas: 8 (reduced from 10)
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 60 (increased from 50)
  targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 70 (increased from 60)
  
  Scaling Policies:
    Scale Up:
      - Increase by 100% when CPU > 60% for 3 minutes
      - Maximum scale up: 2 pods per minute
    Scale Down:
      - Decrease by 50% when CPU < 40% for 10 minutes
      - Maximum scale down: 1 pod per 5 minutes
  
  Cost Impact: 25% reduction in average pod count

Cluster Autoscaler Optimization:
  scale-down-delay-after-add: 10m (reduced from 20m)
  scale-down-unneeded-time: 5m (reduced from 10m)
  scale-down-utilization-threshold: 0.7 (increased from 0.5)
  
  Result: 30% faster scale-down, better resource utilization
```

#### Scheduled Scaling for Non-Production
```yaml
Development Environment Scheduling:
  Business Hours (8 AM - 6 PM EST, Monday-Friday):
    - Minimum 1 instance running
    - Auto-scaling enabled
  
  Off-Hours (Nights, Weekends):
    - All instances stopped
    - Database scheduled stop/start
    - 70% cost reduction during off-hours

Staging Environment Scheduling:
  Testing Hours (9 AM - 5 PM EST, Monday-Friday):
    - Full environment available
    - Performance testing capabilities
  
  Maintenance Windows (Weekends):
    - Reduced to minimal configuration
    - Automated environment refresh
    - 60% cost reduction during maintenance windows
```

## Reserved Instances & Savings Plans

### Reserved Instance Strategy

#### Production Environment Reservations
```yaml
EC2 Reserved Instances (1-Year Term):
  Instance Type: t3.medium
  Quantity: 4 instances
  Payment: All upfront
  Savings: 40% compared to on-demand
  
  Cost Analysis:
    On-Demand: $134/month x 12 = $1,608/year
    Reserved: $965/year (all upfront)
    Savings: $643/year per environment

RDS Reserved Instances (1-Year Term):
  Instance Type: db.t3.medium
  Multi-AZ: Yes
  Payment: Partial upfront
  Savings: 35% compared to on-demand
  
  Cost Analysis:
    On-Demand: $135/month x 12 = $1,620/year
    Reserved: $1,053/year
    Savings: $567/year
```

#### Compute Savings Plans
```yaml
EC2 Instance Savings Plan:
  Commitment: $800/month for 1 year
  Discount: Up to 66% on EC2 usage
  Flexibility: Any instance type, size, OS, tenancy, region
  
  Coverage Analysis:
    Total monthly compute: $1,200
    Savings Plan coverage: $800 (67%)
    Remaining on-demand: $400
    Total savings: $2,400/year

SageMaker Savings Plan (Future ML workloads):
  Commitment: $100/month for 1 year
  Discount: Up to 64% on SageMaker usage
  Preparation for future machine learning initiatives
```

### Savings Plan Optimization Strategy
```yaml
Analysis Methodology:
  1. Historical usage analysis (12 months)
  2. Growth projection modeling
  3. Seasonal usage pattern identification
  4. Reserved capacity vs flexibility trade-off

Recommendations:
  - Cover 70% of baseline usage with Reserved Instances
  - Use Savings Plans for variable workloads
  - Maintain 30% on-demand for elasticity
  - Review and adjust quarterly
```
