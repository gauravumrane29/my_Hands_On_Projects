# VPC Configuration
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = {
    Name        = "microservice-vpc"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Multi-AZ Subnet Configuration
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count             = 3
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${count.index + 1}.0/24"
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count             = 3
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${count.index + 10}.0/24"
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]
}
```

#### EKS Cluster Configuration
```hcl
# EKS Cluster with Enhanced Security
module "eks" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"

  cluster_name    = "java-microservice-cluster"
  cluster_version = "1.27"

  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  subnet_ids = aws_subnet.private[*].id

  # Enhanced security configuration
  cluster_endpoint_private_access = true
  cluster_endpoint_public_access  = true
  cluster_endpoint_public_access_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

  cluster_encryption_config = [{
    provider_key_arn = aws_kms_key.eks.arn
    resources        = ["secrets"]
  }]

  node_groups = {
    main = {
      desired_capacity = 3
      max_capacity     = 10
      min_capacity     = 2

## Application Migration

### Containerization Strategy

#### Multi-Stage Dockerfile Optimization
```dockerfile
# Migration: From monolithic deployment to containerized
FROM maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-17 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Dependency caching optimization
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# Build application
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Production runtime image
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine

# Security: Non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S appgroup && \
    adduser -u 1001 -S appuser -G appgroup

WORKDIR /app

# Copy application artifact
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Security and optimization
RUN chown -R appuser:appgroup /app
USER appuser

# Health check implementation
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1

EXPOSE 8080

# Optimized JVM settings
ENTRYPOINT ["java", \
    "-XX:+UseContainerSupport", \
    "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0", \
    "-XX:+UseG1GC", \
    "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### Application Modernization

#### Configuration Externalization
```yaml
# Before: application.properties in JAR
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/myapp
spring.datasource.username=admin
spring.datasource.password=password123

# After: ConfigMap + Secrets
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: java-microservice-config
data:
  application.yml: |
    server:
      port: 8080
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:mysql://${DB_HOST}:3306/${DB_NAME}
        username: ${DB_USERNAME}
        password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      jpa:
        hibernate:
          ddl-auto: validate
        properties:
          hibernate:
            dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
    management:
      endpoints:
        web:
          exposure:
            include: health,info,prometheus,metrics
      endpoint:
        health:
          show-details: always
```

#### Observability Enhancement
```java
// Added Micrometer metrics for cloud monitoring
@RestController
@Timed(name = "api.requests", description = "API request timing")
public class HelloController {
    
    private final MeterRegistry meterRegistry;
    private final Counter requestCounter;
    
    public HelloController(MeterRegistry meterRegistry) {
        this.meterRegistry = meterRegistry;
        this.requestCounter = Counter.builder("api.requests.total")
            .description("Total API requests")
            .register(meterRegistry);
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    @Timed(name = "hello.requests", description = "Hello endpoint timing")
    public ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
        requestCounter.increment();
        
        Timer timer = Timer.start(meterRegistry);
        try {
            // Business logic
            String response = "Hello from Modernized Java Microservice!";
            return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
        } finally {
            timer.stop(Timer.builder("hello.duration")
                .description("Hello endpoint duration")
                .register(meterRegistry));
        }
    }
}
```

```

## Data Migration

### Database Migration Strategy

#### Pre-Migration Preparation
```sql
-- Database optimization before migration
-- Analyze current database performance
ANALYZE TABLE users, orders, products;

-- Check for potential issues

    TABLE_NAME,
    TABLE_ROWS,
    DATA_LENGTH,
    INDEX_LENGTH,
    DATA_FREE
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'production_db';

-- Identify large tables that need special handling
SELECT 
    TABLE_NAME,
    ROUND(((DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) / 1024 / 1024), 2) AS 'Size in MB'
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'production_db'
ORDER BY (DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) DESC;

response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://api.example.com/actuator/health)
if [ "$response" = "200" ]; then
    echo "✅ Health check passed"
else
    echo "❌ Health check failed: $response"
    exit 1
fi

# Database connectivity test
echo "Checking database connectivity..."
kubectl exec -n production deployment/java-microservice -- \
    curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/db
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Database connectivity verified"
else
    echo "❌ Database connectivity failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Performance validation
echo "Running performance validation..."
response_time=$(curl -s -w "%{time_total}" -o /dev/null http://api.example.com/api/users)
if (( $(echo "$response_time < 0.5" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "✅ Performance target met: ${response_time}s"
else
    echo "⚠️ Performance slower than target: ${response_time}s"
fi

# Data integrity check
echo "Validating data integrity..."
kubectl exec -n production deployment/java-microservice -- \
    java -jar /app/data-validation-tool.jar --compare-checksums
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Data integrity validated"
else
    echo "❌ Data integrity check failed"
    exit 1
fi

echo "🎉 Migration validation completed successfully!"
```

### Rollback Strategy

#### Automated Rollback Procedures
```yaml
Rollback Triggers:
  - Application health check failures (>3 consecutive)
  - Response time degradation (>2x baseline)
  - Error rate increase (>5%)
  - Database connectivity issues
  - Memory or CPU threshold exceeded

Rollback Process:
  1. ArgoCD automatic rollback to previous Git commit
  2. Database failback to on-premises (if within 2-hour window)
  3. DNS switch back to legacy infrastructure
  4. Load balancer traffic redirection
  5. Monitoring alert notifications

Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 15 minutes
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 1 minute
