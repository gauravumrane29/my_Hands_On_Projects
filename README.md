# 3-Tier DevOps Project
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps pipeline including infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, CI/CD, containerization, and Kubernetes deployment using Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.

## üèóÔ∏è Full-Stack Architecture

### Application Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.1.5 with PostgreSQL integration, JPA/Hibernate, Flyway migrations
- **Frontend**: React 18 TypeScript with Vite tooling, modern component architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.4 with connection pooling, automated backups, multi-AZ support
- **Cache**: Redis ElastiCache cluster with encryption, session management

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform with AWS provider (VPC, RDS, ElastiCache, ALB, Auto Scaling)
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible playbooks for server setup, application deployment, database initialization
- **Containerization**: Docker multi-service orchestration with health checks and networking
- **Kubernetes**: Helm charts with Bitnami dependencies, HPA, multi-environment support
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins pipeline with parallel builds, security scanning, multi-environment deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger tracing, CloudWatch with comprehensive observability
